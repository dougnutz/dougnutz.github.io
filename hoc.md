# HOC 
Hour of code is based on the concepts from [Hour of code](https://hourofcode.com/us">)
    The concept is simple. I highly recommend starting there. 
    The repository [HOC](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc) is my extension of those ideas to teach my own kids and neighborhood kids.
### HOC projects
These projects have been tested with ages 10-12. They take on average about an hour. I recommend a little extra time for free experimentation at the end. 
    - [Blink](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Blink) The "Hello World" of the arduino ecosystem.
    - [Blink2](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Blink2) Take blink to the next level with external LED's
    - [HelloWorld](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/HelloWorld) Simple Writing to a screen and drawing shapes
    - [ReadTheWeb](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/ReadTheWeb) Learn to use helper files (includes) and fetch a file from the internet
      -[Edit form](https://dougnutz.github.io/readtheweb) A simple form submitter that allows for saving and editing of the file use in the ReadTheWebProject. This requires some setup ahead of time. Alternative solutions can be found in [Echo](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Echo).
