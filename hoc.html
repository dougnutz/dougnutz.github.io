    <h1>HOC </h1><p>Hour of code is based on the concepts from [Hour of code](https://hourofcode.com/us)<br/>
    The concept is simple. I highly recommend starting there. 
    This repository and the [HOC](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc) repository is my extension of those ideas to teach my own kids and neighborhood kids.</p>
